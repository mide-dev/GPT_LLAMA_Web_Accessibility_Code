        "rawOutput": "Given the violation description, the issue is with the use of the `aria-expanded` attribute on an element where it is not allowed or is not appropriate. The `aria-expanded` attribute is typically used with elements that control the expansion or collapse of content, such as buttons or links that act as triggers for dropdowns, accordions, or collapsible panels.\n\nIn the provided incorrect HTML example, the element is a `label`, which is not typically used as a trigger for expandable content. Instead, `label` elements are designed to provide an accessible name for other elements, usually form controls. \n\nTo correct this HTML for accessibility while adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, we need to ensure that the `aria-expanded` attribute is used correctly, likely by moving it to a more appropriate element that acts as a control for expanding or collapsing content. Since the example does not provide the full context or the elements that are being controlled, a generic correction will be provided based on common practices.\n\n### Corrected HTML:\n\n```html\n<!-- Assuming there's a button that controls the collapsing and expanding of content -->\n<button aria-controls=\"collapseOne\" aria-expanded=\"true\" class=\"radio\" data-target=\"#offerbox-main-buy-now-details\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">\n  Toggle Details\n</button>\n<label for=\"controlElement\">Label Text</label>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Thought:** The `aria-expanded` attribute needs to be associated with an interactive element that controls the visibility of another element.\n2. **Observation:** The `label` element is not the correct host for `aria-expanded` since it doesn't typically serve as an interactive control for expandable content.\n3. **Action:** Move the `aria-expanded` attribute to a more appropriate interactive element, like a `button`, that serves as a control for expanding or collapsing content. Ensure that the button is correctly associated with the content it controls using `aria-controls`.\n\nThis correction assumes that there is a need for an interactive control (like a button) to manage the visibility of an element with an ID of `collapseOne`. The `label` element is left untouched or modified as needed but without the `aria-expanded` attribute, which is not applicable to it based on the described violation."

        "afterModification": "<button aria-controls=\"leaseCalculator\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"radio\" data-target=\"#offerbox-main-lease-calculator\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">Lease Calculator</button>",
        "rawOutput": "Based on the WCAG 2.1 violation description that indicates an ARIA attribute is not allowed (`aria-expanded=\"false\"`), it's important to first understand the role and purpose of the `label` element in question. The `label` element is primarily used to provide a label for another control or element. The use of `aria-expanded` on a `label` is inappropriate because `aria-expanded` is used to indicate the state of expandable content, which is more fitting for elements that control visibility of content, such as buttons or links that act as triggers for collapsible content.\n\nGiven this context, the correction would involve removing the `aria-expanded=\"false\"` attribute from the `label` and ensuring the expandable functionality is properly associated with an interactive element that controls the visibility of the `#leaseCalculator`. If the `label` is intended to act as a trigger for expanding or collapsing content, it should be changed to a more appropriate interactive element, like a button, which can properly support the `aria-expanded` attribute.\n\n**Corrected HTML:**\n\nOption 1: If the `label` is not meant to act as a trigger (and there's another element intended for this purpose), simply remove the `aria-expanded` attribute:\n\n```html\n<label class=\"radio\" data-target=\"#offerbox-main-lease-calculator\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">Lease Calculator</label>\n```\n\nOption 2: If the `label` was incorrectly used and should be an interactive element like a button to toggle the visibility of content, then change the element to a button and retain the `aria-expanded` attribute to reflect its state properly:\n\n```html\n<button aria-controls=\"leaseCalculator\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"radio\" data-target=\"#offerbox-main-lease-calculator\" data-toggle=\"collapse\">Lease Calculator</button>\n```\n\nThis correction ensures that the functionality to expand or collapse content is correctly associated with an interactive element that is allowed to use the `aria-expanded` attribute, improving accessibility by adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines."

        "rawOutput": "- Thought: The use of `aria-expanded=\"false\"` indicates that the element controls the expansion of another element, which is typically associated with interactive elements like buttons, but not usually with labels. Labels are not interactive elements and do not typically control the expansion or collapse of content. Therefore, using `aria-expanded` on a label is not appropriate according to ARIA specifications and WCAG guidelines.\n\n- Observation: To make this HTML accessible and compliant with WCAG 2.1, the control functionality (including `aria-expanded`) should be moved to an interactive element such as a button. The `label` element should be used for labeling form elements, and the interactive element that controls the expansion should be clearly associated with the content it controls.\n\n- Action: Move the `aria-expanded` attribute to an appropriate interactive element (e.g., a button) that actually controls the collapsing and expanding of the associated content. Ensure that the interactive element is correctly associated with the content it controls through `aria-controls`.\n\n- Corrected HTML:\n```html\n<label for=\"toggleOfferDetails\" class=\"radio\">Make Offer Details</label>\n<button aria-controls=\"makeOfferDetails\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"button\" data-target=\"#offerbox-main-make-offer-details\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" id=\"toggleOfferDetails\">Toggle Offer Details</button>\n```\n\nIn this correction:\n- A `button` element is introduced to serve as the interactive control for toggling the display of the details. This is appropriate because a button is an interactive element that users can activate to perform actions.\n- The `aria-expanded` attribute is moved to the `button` element to correctly indicate that this button controls the expansion and collapse of content associated with `#makeOfferDetails`.\n- The `label` element now serves its correct purpose of providing a label, and it's associated with the button through the use of descriptive text. If the label were meant to label a form element, the `for` attribute should match the `id` of the form element it labels, but in this context, it's used to provide textual context for the button."
