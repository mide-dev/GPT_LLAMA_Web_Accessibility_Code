        "rawOutput": "To correct the HTML for accessibility based on the WCAG 2.1 violation description, we need to address the issue of missing ARIA attributes, specifically `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`, which are essential for elements with a role of \"combobox\". These attributes inform assistive technologies about the state of the combobox and which element is controlled by the combobox, respectively.\n\n- **Thought**: Since the element has a role of \"combobox\", it's crucial to ensure that all necessary ARIA attributes are present to make it fully accessible. The `aria-expanded` attribute indicates if the combobox is currently expanded or collapsed, which is vital information for screen reader users. The `aria-controls` attribute should reference the ID of the list that the combobox controls, helping users understand the relationship between the combobox and the list of options it presents.\n\n- **Observation**: According to WCAG guidelines, a combobox must have `aria-expanded` to inform users about its expandable nature and `aria-controls` to indicate which element it controls. Without these attributes, the accessibility and usability of the combobox for people relying on assistive technologies are significantly decreased.\n\n- **Action**: Add `aria-expanded=\"false\"` (assuming the combobox is collapsed by default) and `aria-controls=\"ID_of_list\"` (you need to replace `\"ID_of_list\"` with the actual ID of the list controlled by the combobox) to the HTML.\n\n- **Corrected HTML**:\n```html\n<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"ID_of_list\" class=\"form-control\">\n```\n\nNote: You'll need to ensure that there is an element (such as a list) that represents the options of the combobox, and it should have an ID that matches the value you put in `aria-controls=\"ID_of_list\"`. Adjust `\"ID_of_list\"` to the actual ID of that element."

        "rawOutput": "To correct the provided HTML for accessibility and comply with WCAG 2.1 guidelines, particularly focusing on the violation that required ARIA attributes are not present (specifically, `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for an element with a role of \"combobox\"), we need to add these missing attributes. The `aria-expanded` attribute indicates whether the combobox is currently expanded or not, which is crucial for screen readers to convey the state of the combobox to users. The `aria-controls` attribute should reference the ID of the element that is controlled by the combobox, typically the ID of the list that contains the options or suggestions based on the search input.\n\n- Incorrect HTML: `<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"المدينة\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" class=\"form-control\">`\n\n- Thought: Since this input element is marked with a role of \"combobox\", it is essential to provide additional information about its expandable nature and what it controls for assistive technologies. This is done through the `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes.\n\n- Observation: For a combobox, `aria-expanded` is required to indicate if the combobox's options are visible, and `aria-controls` must reference the ID of the list that shows the options or suggestions.\n\n- Action: Add `aria-expanded=\"false\"` to indicate that the combobox is initially collapsed and `aria-controls=\"listboxID\"` where `\"listboxID\"` is the ID of the element containing the list of options. Note that you'll need to ensure there is an actual element with the ID that matches `\"listboxID\"` in your document.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"المدينة\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"listboxID\" class=\"form-control\">`\n\nPlease replace `\"listboxID\"` with the actual ID of the list element that the combobox controls."

        "rawOutput": "Given the WCAG 2.1 violation description, it's clear that the `<input>` element with a role of \"combobox\" lacks the required ARIA attributes `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`, which are necessary for accessibility compliance. These attributes help assistive technologies understand the state of the combobox and its relationship to another element that contains the list of options it controls.\n\n- **Thought**: Since the element is marked with a role of \"combobox\", it is intended to function as a composite widget containing both the input and an associated list of options. To be accessible, users need to know whether the list of options is currently visible (expanded) or not, and which element contains the list of options.\n\n- **Observation**: According to WCAG 2.1, a combobox must have `aria-expanded` to indicate if the options are visible or not, and `aria-controls` to reference the ID of the list that contains the options. However, since the example provided does not include the actual list (e.g., `<ul>`, `<div>`, etc.), I'll assume a generic ID for demonstration purposes.\n\n- **Action**: Add `aria-expanded=\"false\"` to indicate that the list of options is initially not visible. Since we don't have the actual list element in the example, I'll also add a placeholder ID to `aria-controls` (e.g., `aria-controls=\"optionsList\"`), assuming that there will be an element with the ID of `optionsList` containing the options related to the combobox.\n\n- **Corrected HTML**:\n```html\n<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"الحي\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"optionsList\" class=\"form-control\">\n```\n\nThis corrected HTML now includes the necessary ARIA attributes for a combobox role, making it more accessible according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Remember, in a real-world scenario, you should replace `\"optionsList\"` with the actual ID of the element that contains the list of options this combobox controls."

        "rawOutput": "To correct the HTML for accessibility based on the WCAG 2.1 violation description provided, we need to address the missing ARIA attributes specifically mentioned: `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`. These attributes are crucial for elements with a role of `combobox` to ensure they are accessible and provide the necessary information to assistive technologies about the state and relationship of the combobox with its list of options.\n\n### Incorrect HTML:\n```html\n<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"فترة المناوبة\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" class=\"form-control\">\n```\n\n### Thought:\nThe element has a role of `combobox`, which indicates it is a composite widget made up of multiple interactive elements, typically an input box and a list of options. The `aria-expanded` attribute is needed to inform assistive technologies whether the combobox is currently expanded (showing its options) or collapsed. The `aria-controls` attribute is required to reference the ID of the element that contains the list of options the combobox controls.\n\n### Observation:\nAccording to WCAG 2.1, a combobox must have `aria-expanded` to indicate its current state and `aria-controls` to establish a relationship between the combobox and the list it controls. However, since the corrected HTML cannot reference a specific list without knowing its ID, a generic approach will be illustrated.\n\n### Action:\n- Add `aria-expanded=\"false\"` to indicate that the combobox is initially collapsed.\n- Add `aria-controls=\"listboxID\"` to reference the ID of the list controlled by the combobox. Note: \"listboxID\" should be replaced with the actual ID of the list element associated with the combobox.\n\n### Corrected HTML:\n```html\n<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"فترة المناوبة\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"listboxID\" class=\"form-control\">\n```\n\n**Note:** The actual ID value for `aria-controls` should match the ID of the element that contains the options or list items associated with this combobox."
