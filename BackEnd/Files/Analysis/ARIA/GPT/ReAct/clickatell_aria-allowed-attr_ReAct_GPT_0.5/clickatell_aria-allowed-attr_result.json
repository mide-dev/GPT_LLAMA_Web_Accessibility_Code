        "rawOutput": "Given the violation description that an ARIA attribute is not allowed: aria-selected=\"true\", and considering the role of the element is a \"button\", we need to correct the use of aria attributes to reflect the appropriate states and properties for a button. Buttons typically do not use `aria-selected` because this attribute is more suited for items in a list or tab roles where selection among multiple items is possible. Instead, buttons may use `aria-pressed` to indicate a toggled state if applicable. However, without further context that this button acts as a toggle button, we should simply remove the `aria-selected` attribute.\n\n- Incorrect HTML: \n```html\n<div role=\"button\" aria-selected=\"true\" aria-label=\"Click to select the Dischem tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\"></div>\n```\n\n- Thought: The `aria-selected` attribute is not appropriate for elements with the role of \"button\". If the button is meant to reflect a toggle state, `aria-pressed` would be more appropriate. However, without indication that it's a toggle button, the best course of action is to remove the `aria-selected` attribute.\n\n- Observation: Buttons do not require `aria-selected`; this attribute is used for roles where selection from a set is possible, such as options in a listbox or tabs in a tablist.\n\n- Action: Remove `aria-selected=\"true\"` from the HTML.\n\n- Corrected HTML: \n```html\n<div role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Click to select the Dischem tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\"></div>\n```\n\nThis correction ensures the button is properly labeled for assistive technologies without misusing ARIA attributes, adhering to WCAG 2.1 guidelines."

        "rawOutput": "Given the WCAG 2.1 violation description that an ARIA attribute \"aria-selected\" is not allowed in the context provided, here's how to correct the HTML:\n\n- Incorrect HTML: `<div role=\"button\" aria-selected=\"false\" aria-label=\"Click to select the Imperial tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\">`\n\n- Thought: The element has a role of \"button\", and it incorrectly uses the ARIA attribute `aria-selected=\"false\"`. The `aria-selected` attribute is not appropriate for elements with a role of \"button\" as it is typically used with roles that involve selection from a list of options, such as \"option\", \"tab\", etc.\n\n- Observation: For an element with a role of \"button\", it's important to use ARIA attributes that are relevant and allowed for that role. The `aria-selected` attribute should be replaced or removed because it does not apply to buttons. Instead, attributes like `aria-pressed` could be more appropriate if the intention is to indicate a pressed state for toggle buttons.\n\n- Action: Since `aria-selected` is not allowed for a button role and there's no indication that this is a toggle button (which could use `aria-pressed`), the best course of action is to remove the `aria-selected` attribute.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<div role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Click to select the Imperial tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\">`\n\nThis correction ensures that the HTML is more accessible by adhering to the proper use of ARIA attributes according to the roles assigned to elements, thus avoiding confusion for users of assistive technologies."

        "rawOutput": "Given the WCAG 2.1 violation description that an ARIA attribute is not allowed: `aria-selected=\"false\"` in the context of the provided incorrect HTML, we need to correct it for accessibility. The violation hints that the `aria-selected` attribute is not appropriate for the role it's being used with. In this case, the role is `\"button\"`, and `aria-selected` is typically used with roles that involve selection from a list of options, such as `\"option\"` or `\"tab\"`.\n\n### Thought Process:\n- The element has a role of `\"button\"`, which indicates an action can be taken by clicking or pressing the element.\n- The `aria-selected` attribute is not typically associated with buttons, as buttons do not have a \"selected\" state in the same way that options in a list or tabs do.\n- To make the button accessible, we should ensure that it has appropriate attributes for its role, which may include `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons but not `aria-selected`.\n\n### Observation:\n- The use of `aria-selected=\"false\"` on an element with a role of `\"button\"` is incorrect because it misrepresents the button's state and functionality to assistive technologies.\n- Correcting this requires either changing the role to one that supports `aria-selected` (if the intent was actually to mark something as selectable) or removing the `aria-selected` attribute if the element is truly meant to act as a button.\n\n### Action:\n- Since the context suggests the element is acting as a button (given the `role=\"button\"`), and there's no indication it's meant to be used as a selectable item in a list or a tab, the correct action is to remove the `aria-selected=\"false\"` attribute.\n- Ensure other necessary attributes for accessibility are present, like `aria-label` for descriptive labeling, which is correctly included.\n\n### Corrected HTML:\n```html\n<div role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Click to select the FlySafair tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\"></div>\n```\n\nThis correction removes the incorrect `aria-selected=\"false\"` attribute while retaining the `role=\"button\"`, `aria-label`, and `tabindex=\"0\"` attributes, ensuring the element is accessible and its role and state are communicated accurately to assistive technologies."

        "rawOutput": "Based on the WCAG 2.1 violation description provided, the issue is with the use of `aria-selected=\"false\"` on an element with a role that does not support this attribute. The `role=\"button\"` does not inherently support the `aria-selected` attribute because buttons are not typically used in a context where selection between multiple options is indicated. Instead, buttons are used to trigger actions. The `aria-selected` attribute is more appropriate for roles that involve selection from a set of options, such as `role=\"option\"` in a listbox.\n\nTo correct the HTML for accessibility, we should remove the `aria-selected=\"false\"` attribute from the element with `role=\"button\"`. If the intention is to indicate a selected state, we might need to reconsider the role or the method used to convey that state to assistive technologies. For a button, states like `aria-pressed` for toggle buttons or using different aria attributes or classes to indicate state changes might be more appropriate.\n\n- Incorrect HTML: `<div role=\"button\" aria-selected=\"false\" aria-label=\"Click to select the Telkom tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\">`\n\n- Thought: The `aria-selected=\"false\"` attribute is not appropriate for an element with `role=\"button\"` as it does not convey a selection state in the context of a button. We need to remove or replace this attribute to make the HTML compliant with WCAG 2.1 guidelines.\n\n- Observation: Buttons trigger actions and do not typically represent a selection state in a set of options. If it's necessary to indicate a state, other methods or roles should be considered.\n\n- Action: Remove the `aria-selected=\"false\"` attribute from the element.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<div role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Click to select the Telkom tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\">`\n\nThis correction addresses the WCAG 2.1 violation by removing the inappropriate use of `aria-selected` on a button role, thereby improving the accessibility of the HTML element."

        "rawOutput": "Given the violation description and the examples provided, it's clear that the use of `aria-selected=\"false\"` on an element with a role of \"button\" is not appropriate according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines. The attribute `aria-selected` is typically used with roles that imply a selection from a list of options, such as \"option\", \"tab\", etc., and not with the \"button\" role. Buttons should use `aria-pressed` for indicating pressed states if needed, especially for toggle buttons. However, if the intention is not to create a toggle button but simply to indicate a button that can be activated or selected for a different purpose (like changing a view or tab), it's better to remove the `aria-selected` attribute altogether, as its usage here is misleading and not semantically correct for buttons.\n\n### Action:\n- Remove `aria-selected=\"false\"` from the HTML, as it is not a valid or necessary attribute for elements with a role of \"button\".\n- If the button is intended to act as a toggle button (which seems not to be the case based on the description), consider using `aria-pressed` instead. However, based on the provided context, this doesn't seem necessary.\n\n### Corrected HTML:\n```html\n<div role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Click to select the Web Africa tab.\" tabindex=\"0\" class=\"CustomerSuccessstyled__ImageWrap-sc-1kt39ue-8 lkacQL\"></div>\n```\n\nThis correction ensures the button's accessibility is improved by removing the incorrect use of `aria-selected` and aligning the element's attributes with proper ARIA practices as per WCAG 2.1 guidelines."
