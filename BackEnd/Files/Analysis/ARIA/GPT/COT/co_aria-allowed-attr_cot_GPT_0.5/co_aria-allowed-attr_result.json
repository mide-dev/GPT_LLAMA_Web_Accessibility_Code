        "rawOutput": "Thought: The violation points out that the `aria-orientation=\"horizontal\"` attribute is not allowed or is incorrectly applied in this context. This attribute is typically used with roles that inherently require orientation information, like sliders, scrollbars, or tabs. However, the div element in the provided HTML does not have a role that supports this attribute. To correct this, we need to either remove the `aria-orientation` attribute if it's unnecessary or ensure that the element has a proper role that supports this attribute and where specifying the orientation is meaningful.\n\nCorrected HTML:\n- If the `aria-orientation` attribute is unnecessary, simply remove it:\n```html\n<div class=\"hf-provider-1rqnzv6\" data-genesis-element=\"BASE\"><hr class=\"hf-provider-c6fpx3\" data-genesis-element=\"BASE\"></div>\n```\n\n- If the intention was to use a component that requires an orientation (and assuming it was meant to be a tablist, toolbar, or similar component that supports `aria-orientation`), you need to assign an appropriate role to the div:\n```html\n<div class=\"hf-provider-1rqnzv6\" role=\"tablist\" data-genesis-element=\"BASE\" aria-orientation=\"horizontal\"><hr class=\"hf-provider-c6fpx3\" data-genesis-element=\"BASE\"></div>\n```\nIn this correction, I assumed a `role=\"tablist\"` as an example of a component that could logically have a horizontal orientation. The specific role you choose should match the actual component's purpose and behavior in your application."
