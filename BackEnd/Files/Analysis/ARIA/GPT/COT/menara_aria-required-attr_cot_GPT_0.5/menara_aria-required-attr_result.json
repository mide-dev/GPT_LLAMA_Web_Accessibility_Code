The violation mentions the absence of `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`, which are crucial for a combobox. `aria-expanded` indicates whether the combobox is expanded or collapsed, which is essential for screen reader users to understand whether they can interact with additional options. `aria-controls` points to the ID of the element that is controlled by the combobox, usually a list of options or suggestions that appear when the combobox is expanded. Without these attributes, users might not be able to navigate or understand the functionality of the combobox properly.\n\nCorrected HTML: \n```html\n<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"optionsList\" class=\"form-control\">\n```\n\nThis correction includes `aria-expanded=\"false\"` to indicate that the combobox is initially collapsed and `aria-controls=\"optionsList\"` to associate the input with the ID of the list that contains the options or suggestions. Note that you would need to ensure there is an element with an ID of `optionsList` that contains the options or suggestions for this combobox."

This is essential for screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand the state and relationship of the combobox and its list, fulfilling the WCAG 2.1 requirement for necessary ARIA attributes.\n\nCorrected HTML: \n```html\n<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"المدينة\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"listboxID\" class=\"form-control\">\n```\n\nNote: In this corrected HTML, `aria-expanded=\"false\"` indicates that the combobox list is not expanded by default. You should dynamically change this attribute to `true` when the user interacts with the combobox to expand the list. Also, `aria-controls=\"listboxID\"` should reference the ID of the list that is being controlled by this combobox. Ensure you replace `\"listboxID\"` with the actual ID of the list element in your implementation."

The original HTML does not include these attributes, which are necessary for accessibility tools to properly interact with and provide feedback about the state and relationship of the combobox and its associated list.\n\n- Incorrect HTML: `<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"الحي\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" class=\"form-control\">`\n\n- Thought: Since the element has a role of \"combobox\", it should have `aria-expanded` to indicate whether the options are visible or not and `aria-controls` to reference the ID of the list that contains the options. Without these, users relying on screen readers or other assistive technologies might not be able to understand if the combobox is expanded or collapsed, nor would they be able to easily navigate the options. \n\n- Corrected HTML: `<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"الحي\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"listboxID\" class=\"form-control\">`\n\nIn this corrected HTML, `aria-expanded=\"false\"` indicates that the combobox is initially collapsed. The value should be dynamically updated (to \"true\" or \"false\") with JavaScript based on the user's interaction to reflect the current state of the combobox. Also, `aria-controls=\"listboxID\"` should reference the ID of the element that contains the list of options the combobox is controlling. You would need to ensure there is an element with an ID that matches \"listboxID\" (or whatever ID you use) that contains the options for this combobox."

This is because the role of `combobox` implies an interactive component that expands to show or hide options, and these attributes communicate the state and relationship of the combobox and its list of options to assistive technologies.\n\n- Incorrect HTML: `<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"فترة المناوبة\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" class=\"form-control\">`\n\n- Thought: Since the element has a role of `combobox`, it is necessary to add `aria-expanded` to indicate whether the combobox is currently expanded or collapsed, and `aria-controls` to reference the ID of the element that contains the list of options the combobox controls. Without these, assistive technologies might not correctly convey the state and operability of the combobox to users.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<input type=\"search\" autocomplete=\"off\" placeholder=\"فترة المناوبة\" role=\"combobox\" aria-label=\"Search for option\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"listboxId\" class=\"form-control\">`\n\nNote: `aria-expanded=\"false\"` is an example state indicating that the combobox is currently collapsed. This state should be dynamically updated (to `true` or `false`) based on the interaction. Also, `\"listboxId\"` should be replaced with the actual ID of the listbox element that contains the options related to this combobox. If such a listbox element exists, it must have an `id` attribute that matches the value provided in the `aria-controls` attribute of the combobox."
