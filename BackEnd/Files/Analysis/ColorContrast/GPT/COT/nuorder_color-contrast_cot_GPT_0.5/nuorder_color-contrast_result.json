I'll choose a darker shade of the original background color (#00a9a4) to maintain the visual design integrity while ensuring the contrast ratio meets or exceeds the 4.5:1 requirement.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<input type=\"submit\" class=\"hs-button primary large\" style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #00736b;\" value=\"Subscribe\">`\n\nThis alteration changes the background color to a darker shade (#00736b), which should sufficiently increase the contrast ratio with the white text to meet the WCAG 2.1 standards.
