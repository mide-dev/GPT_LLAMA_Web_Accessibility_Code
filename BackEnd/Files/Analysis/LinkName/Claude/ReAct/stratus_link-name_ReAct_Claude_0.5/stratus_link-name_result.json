        "rawOutput": "Here are the steps to correct the HTML for accessibility:\n\n- Incorrect HTML: <a class=\"column-link\" target=\"_self\" href=\"/industry/smart-buildings/\"></a>\n\n- Thought: I need to correct the above HTML by adding accessible text to the link. Since the \"href\" points to a relative URL, I can infer the link text from the URL segments.\n\n- Observation: The \"href\" URL contains segments \"industry\" and \"smart-buildings\".\n\n- Thought: I'll use these URL segments to provide meaningful link text between the opening and closing <a> tags.\n\n- Corrected HTML: <a class=\"column-link\" target=\"_self\" href=\"/industry/smart-buildings/\">Smart Buildings Industry</a>\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Added link text \"Smart Buildings Industry\" between the <a> tags, making it accessible to screen readers and visible to users\n2. The link text is derived from the URL segments to provide relevant context\n\nThis corrected HTML should resolve the WCAG 2.1 accessibility violation by providing accessible text for the link element."
