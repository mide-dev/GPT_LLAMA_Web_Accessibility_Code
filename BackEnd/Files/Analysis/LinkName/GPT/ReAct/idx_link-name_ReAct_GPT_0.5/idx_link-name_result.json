        "rawOutput": "To correct the provided HTML for accessibility, we need to address the issues outlined in the WCAG 2.1 violation description. The element in question is a link (`<a>` tag) that uses JavaScript (`javascript:void(0)`) for its `href` attribute and contains an icon (`<i>` tag with class `fa fa-bars`) typically used for a menu button. This element is likely to be in the tab order due to its nature as a link but does not have accessible text, making it difficult for screen readers to interpret its function.\n\n- **Observation**: The link appears to be a button for expanding a menu, indicated by the \"fa-bars\" class (commonly used for menu icons).\n- **Thought**: We need to make this element accessible by providing text that screen readers can use to describe its function. We can use `aria-label` for this purpose since the element does not contain visible text. Additionally, we should ensure that the element is still operable and conveys its purpose to users of assistive technologies.\n\n**Corrected HTML**:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"menu-custom-corp\" aria-label=\"Open menu\"><i class=\"fa fa-bars\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a>\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes**:\n\n1. **`aria-label=\"Open menu\"`**: This provides accessible text that describes the link's function, making it understandable for screen reader users. The choice of \"Open menu\" as the label is based on the assumption that clicking this link would open a navigation menu, which is a common function for an element styled with \"fa-bars\".\n\n2. **`aria-hidden=\"true\"` on the `<i>` element**: This ensures that the icon (which does not convey information necessary for understanding the link's purpose when text is provided via `aria-label`) is hidden from assistive technologies, reducing redundancy and potential confusion.\n\nThese changes address the WCAG 2.1 violations by ensuring the element has accessible text and is properly interpreted by screen readers, without relying solely on visual cues."

        "afterModification": "<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"search-custom-corp\" aria-label=\"Search\" role=\"button\"><i class=\"fa fa-search\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a>",
        "rawOutput": "To correct the provided HTML for accessibility based on the WCAG 2.1 violation description, we need to ensure that the element within the `<a>` tag, which is an icon (indicated by the class \"fa fa-search\"), has accessible text for screen readers and that the anchor element itself has a descriptive title or aria-label for better understanding of its purpose.\n\nGiven that the `<i>` element is used for an icon and likely does not contain any text content, screen readers will not be able to announce anything meaningful for users relying on them. Therefore, we need to add an `aria-label` attribute to the `<a>` tag to provide accessible name for the action it performs. Additionally, adding a `role` attribute with the value \"button\" would be beneficial if the anchor acts as a button, which seems likely given its JavaScript `href` and the presence of a search icon.\n\n### Corrected HTML:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"search-custom-corp\" aria-label=\"Search\" role=\"button\"><i class=\"fa fa-search\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a>\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n\n1. **`aria-label=\"Search\"`**: This attribute provides an accessible name for the link, making it clear for screen reader users that this link is used to perform a search action.\n\n2. **`role=\"button\"`**: Given that this anchor tag triggers a JavaScript action (presumably to open a search box or perform a search), marking it with `role=\"button\"` makes its purpose clearer, especially since it doesn't navigate to a new page or anchor. This helps assistive technologies understand the element's function better.\n\n3. **`aria-hidden=\"true\"` on the `<i>` element**: This ensures that the icon itself is hidden from screen readers, avoiding confusion since the `aria-label` on the parent element already provides the necessary accessible information. Icons are typically visual decorations for sighted users, and the meaningful action description is provided through the `aria-label`.\n\nThese changes enhance the accessibility of the HTML by providing necessary textual descriptions for screen readers, making the web content more inclusive for users with disabilities."

        "afterModification": "<a href=\"#mydiv\"><span class=\"hidden\">Scroll</span></a>`\n  \n- Thought: The anchor tag is intended for scrolling to a specific section, but its accessible name is not clear due to the \"hidden\" class on the span. To ensure the link is accessible, particularly to screen reader users, we need to make sure the text \"Scroll\" is accessible or provide an alternative way for screen readers to understand the purpose of the link. Adding an `aria-label` attribute to the anchor tag can solve this issue, as it provides an accessible name directly on the interactive element. Additionally, adding a title attribute can provide visual users with more context when they hover over the link.\n\n- Action: To correct this, I will add an `aria-label` attribute with a value that clearly describes the action or destination of the link. Since the link's purpose is to scroll to a specific section identified by \"mydiv,\" I will use \"Scroll to section\" as the aria-label value. Additionally, I will add a title attribute with a similar descriptive text to enhance accessibility for users who rely on tooltips.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<a href=\"#mydiv\" aria-label=\"Scroll to section\" title=\"Scroll to section\"><span class=\"hidden\">Scroll</span></a>",
        "rawOutput": "To address the WCAG 2.1 violation described, it's important to ensure that elements within the tab order have accessible text. The given HTML snippet uses a span with a class \"hidden\" which likely means the text is visually hidden and may not be accessible to screen readers depending on how the \"hidden\" class is implemented. Additionally, the anchor tag lacks a title attribute, which could further enhance its accessibility by providing additional context.

The title attribute offers additional information on hover for users who may benefit from this visual cue, thereby improving the link's accessibility according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines."
