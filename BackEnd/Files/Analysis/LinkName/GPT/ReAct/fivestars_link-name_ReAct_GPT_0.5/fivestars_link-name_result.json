To address this, I need to ensure that the link has text visible to screen readers or an appropriate ARIA attribute that provides an accessible name.\n\n- Action: Since the class name suggests it's a logo link, I will search the URL [https://www.fivestars.com] to understand what the link is about and gather context for accessible text.\n\n- Observation: The search result indicates that the URL is associated with \"FiveStars,\" a company or service named FiveStars.\n\n- Thought: Based on the observation, I will use \"FiveStars\" as the accessible name for the link. I can do this by adding an `aria-label` attribute for screen readers since the link seems to be a logo (often an image) and might not have visible text.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<a href=\"https://www.fivestars.com\" class=\"logo--header\" aria-label=\"FiveStars Homepage\">`\n\nThis correction addresses the WCAG 2.1 violation by providing an accessible name using `aria-label`, making the link accessible to screen readers and users who rely on assistive technologies."
