However, the icon itself does not provide any accessible text for screen readers, making it difficult for users relying on assistive technologies to understand the purpose of the link. To correct this, I need to add an accessible name to the link. This can be done in several ways, such as using the `aria-label` attribute on the anchor tag to provide a textual description of the link's destination. Since the link goes to a TikTok profile, an appropriate label would be the name of the profile or a description of its content.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@taylorcorporation\" aria-label=\"Taylor Corporation on TikTok\"><i class=\"fa-brands fa-tiktok\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></a>`"
