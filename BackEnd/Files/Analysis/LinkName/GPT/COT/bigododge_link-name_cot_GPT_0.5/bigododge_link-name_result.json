        "rawOutput": "Given the violation description and the examples provided, the task involves correcting the HTML to ensure it is accessible according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines. The primary issues with the given HTML are:\n\n1. The `<img>` element within the `<a>` tag lacks alternative text, making it inaccessible for screen readers.\n2. The `<a>` tag does not have a descriptive title or accessible text, making it difficult for users to understand the purpose of the link, especially for those using assistive technologies.\n\nTo correct these issues:\n\n- We need to add an `alt` attribute to the `<img>` tag that describes the image or the action it represents. This makes the image accessible to users who rely on screen readers.\n- We should also add a `title` attribute to the `<a>` tag to provide additional context about the link's destination or purpose. This is helpful for users navigating with assistive technologies and for providing context when the mouse hovers over the link.\n\nBased on the URL `/spanish.htm`, it seems the link directs users to a Spanish version of the site or a page related to Spanish content. This context will guide the text we choose for the `alt` and `title` attributes.\n\n**Corrected HTML:**\n\n```html\n<a class=\"btn btn-primary cstBtn ui-button btn-no-decoration\" href=\"/spanish.htm\" target=\"_self\" style=\"z-index: 950; background: none;\" title=\"View Spanish page\">\n<img src=\"//pictures.dealer.com/b/bigocdjcllc/1628/f33b028ba1580c7990a8c7f24d220798x.jpg\" alt=\"Link to Spanish page\"></a>\n```\n\n**Thought Process:**\n\n- For the `alt` attribute of the `<img>` tag, I chose \"Link to Spanish page\" to describe the action since the image is part of a link. This text serves as accessible text for the image, making it clear for screen reader users that this image is linked to a Spanish page.\n- For the `title` attribute of the `<a>` tag, I used \"View Spanish page\" to provide additional context about the link's destination. This title helps users understand where the link will take them, enhancing the link's accessibility."
