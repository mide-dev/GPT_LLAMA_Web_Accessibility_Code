        "rawOutput": "- Thought: In this case, the `<a>` tag lacks accessible text and any attributes that could help screen readers understand its purpose. Since it's a link to a specific section of the Shoppers Stop website related to \"First Citizen Non Member,\" it would be beneficial to add accessible text directly or through attributes like `aria-label` or `title`. Given the context, adding an `aria-label` seems the most straightforward approach to provide accessible text without altering the visible design.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<a href=\"https://www.shoppersstop.com/firstCitizenNonMember\" class=\"brandsWeLoveHomePageCmsComponentATag\" data-sslstaticresponsivebanner=\"\" data-select-uid=\"cmsitem_00422058\" data-select-name=\"web_fc-non-app-strips_2023-02-03\" data-select-position=\"0\" data-select-creative=\"DEFAULT\" aria-label=\"First Citizen Non Member at Shoppers Stop\">`"
