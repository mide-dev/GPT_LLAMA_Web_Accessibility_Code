This can be achieved by adding an `aria-label` attribute or by including visible text within the link. Since it's a logo, using `aria-label` is more appropriate to avoid altering the visual design. The `aria-label` should succinctly describe the link's destination or purpose, such as \"Back to homepage\" or simply the name of the company if the logo is well-recognized.
