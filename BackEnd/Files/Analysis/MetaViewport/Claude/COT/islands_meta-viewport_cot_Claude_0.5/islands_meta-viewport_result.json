I need to update the maximum-scale value to 2.0 or higher to ensure accessibility.\n- Corrected HTML: <meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5\" name=\"viewport\">\n\nIn the corrected HTML, I changed the maximum-scale value from 1 to 5, which is greater than the minimum required value of 2.0. This allows users to zoom in up to 5 times the original size on mobile devices, ensuring better accessibility for users who may need to enlarge the content."
