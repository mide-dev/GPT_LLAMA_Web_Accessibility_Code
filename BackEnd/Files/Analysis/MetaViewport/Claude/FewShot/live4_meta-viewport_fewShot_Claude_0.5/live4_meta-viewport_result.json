The `user-scalable=no` attribute has been changed to `user-scalable=yes`, allowing users to zoom in and out as needed on mobile devices.\n2. The `maximum-scale=1` attribute has been changed to `maximum-scale=2`, allowing users to zoom in up to 2 times the original size, providing more flexibility for users who require zooming.\n\nBy making these changes, the HTML code now complies with WCAG 2.1 guidelines and improves accessibility for users who rely on zooming functionality to access and interact with"
