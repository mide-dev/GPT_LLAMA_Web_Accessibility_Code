        "rawOutput": "- Thought: To comply with WCAG 2.1 and ensure that users can zoom in on mobile devices for better accessibility, I need to remove the restriction imposed by \"maximum-scale=1.2\" or adjust it to allow more significant zooming. Setting \"maximum-scale\" to a value like 2.0 or higher or removing it altogether would be more inclusive. Additionally, enabling user scalability by setting \"user-scalable=yes\" ensures that users can zoom if needed.\n\n- Corrected HTML: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes\">"
