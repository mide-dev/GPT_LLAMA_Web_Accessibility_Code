It's also good practice to ensure that the minimum scale is set in a way that doesn't restrict zooming out, but since WCAG primarily concerns zooming in for accessibility, the focus will be on adjusting the maximum-scale and enabling user scalability.\n\n- Corrected HTML: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0, minimum-scale=1.0\">"
