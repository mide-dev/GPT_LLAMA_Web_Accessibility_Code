        "rawOutput": "- Observation: The meta element above sets the maximum scale to 1.2, which can restrict zooming capabilities for users needing larger text or more detailed view.\n- Thought: According to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, users should be able to zoom in at least up to 200% to ensure content is accessible. Therefore, the maximum scale should be increased or the property should be removed to allow for user-scalable zooming.\n- Action: Remove the maximum-scale property or set it to a value that does not restrict user scaling to less than 200%.\n- Corrected HTML: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes\">"
