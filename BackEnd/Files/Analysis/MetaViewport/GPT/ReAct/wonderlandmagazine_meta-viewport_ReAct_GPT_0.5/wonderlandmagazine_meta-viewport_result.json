        "rawOutput": "- Observation: The meta element above has several issues that prevent user scaling on mobile devices: the `maximum-scale` is set to 1.0, and `user-scalable` is set to no.\n- Thought: I need to remove or adjust these properties to allow for user scaling. According to WCAG 2.1, users must be able to zoom into content up to 200%. Therefore, I should set `user-scalable` to yes and increase the `maximum-scale` or remove the limit.\n- Action: modify[content=\"user-scalable=yes, maximum-scale=2.0\"]\n- Corrected HTML: <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes\">"
