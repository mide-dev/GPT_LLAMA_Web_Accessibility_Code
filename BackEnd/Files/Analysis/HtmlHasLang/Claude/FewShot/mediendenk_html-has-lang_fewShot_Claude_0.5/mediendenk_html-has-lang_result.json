Based on the extracted text \"LOKALMAGAZIN BÜRGERBLICK\", which is in German, the appropriate language code for the lang attribute is \"de\" (representing German). Adding lang=\"de\" to the <html> tag ensures that the webpage's language is correctly identified, improving accessibility for users and assisting technologies like screen readers."
