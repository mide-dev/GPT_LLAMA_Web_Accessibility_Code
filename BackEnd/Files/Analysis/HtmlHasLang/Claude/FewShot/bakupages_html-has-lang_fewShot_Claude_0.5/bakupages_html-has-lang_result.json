Therefore, the `lang` attribute of the `<html>` element should be set to `\"ru\"` to indicate that the content of the webpage is primarily in the Russian language. This helps assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to correctly interpret and pronounce the content for users who rely on these technologies."
