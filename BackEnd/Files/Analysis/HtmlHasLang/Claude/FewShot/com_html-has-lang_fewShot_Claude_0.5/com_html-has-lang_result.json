Therefore, the appropriate language code for the `lang` attribute should be \"zh\", which represents the Chinese language. By adding `lang=\"zh\"` to the `<html>` element, we ensure that the webpage is correctly identified as being in Chinese, improving accessibility for users and assisting screen readers in properly pronouncing the content."
