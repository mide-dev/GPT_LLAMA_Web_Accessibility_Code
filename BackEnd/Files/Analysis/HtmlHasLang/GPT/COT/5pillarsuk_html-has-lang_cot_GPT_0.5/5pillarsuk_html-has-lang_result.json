        "rawOutput": "Given the context provided by the extracted text \"5Pillars\", there's no explicit language context provided directly from the text \"5Pillars\" itself. However, based on common web practices and assuming the content is likely in English (as it's the most common language for web content without further context), the corrected HTML should include a `lang` attribute specifying English. If the content were in another language, the `lang` attribute should reflect that specific language's code.\n\n- Thought: I need to correct the above HTML by adding the \"lang\" attribute. Given no explicit language context from \"5Pillars\", I'll assume English language content, which is common for websites without specified language context. Therefore, I'll add `lang=\"en\"` to specify English as the language for the content.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"en\" prefix=\"og: http://ogp.me/ns#\" class=\"td-md-is-chrome\">`"
