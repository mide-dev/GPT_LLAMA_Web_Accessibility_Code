However, the sentence structure and the name \"Maria\" could suggest that the language is English or possibly a language common in regions where \"Maria\" is a common name. Given the lack of specific context, the safest assumption is to default to English, as it's the most common language for web content unless specified otherwise.\n\n- Corrected HTML: <html lang=\"en\">"
