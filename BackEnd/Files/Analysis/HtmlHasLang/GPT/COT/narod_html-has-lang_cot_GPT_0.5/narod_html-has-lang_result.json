The `lang` attribute is crucial for accessibility as it helps screen readers and other assistive technologies provide the correct language support. Without specific language content provided, I'll default to English (`en`), which is a common practice when the language is unspecified but needs to be assumed for the sake of completing the task.\n\n- Thought: To adhere to WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility, I need to add the `lang` attribute to the `<html>` tag. Since the language of the website content isn't specified, I'll use English (`en`) as a default for this correction. This is a general practice and should ideally be replaced with the correct language code once the content's language is confirmed.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"en\">`\n\nIt's important to note that the correct value for the `lang` attribute should be determined based on the primary language of the page content to ensure accurate accessibility support."
