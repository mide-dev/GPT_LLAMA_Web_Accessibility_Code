However, I will assume the text is in English for the sake of this exercise.\n\n- Thought: Since the extracted text's language isn't specified, I will assume it's in English. Therefore, I need to add the `lang` attribute to the `<html>` tag to improve accessibility, following the WCAG 2.1 guidelines.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"en\"><head></head><body></body></html>`"
