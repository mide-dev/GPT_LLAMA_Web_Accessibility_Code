This helps with accessibility, especially for screen readers, by allowing them to use the correct language settings for pronunciation.\n\n- Observation: Without extracted text to specify the language, I will default to English (\"en\") as it is the most common language for web content and the language used in the task instructions.\n\n- Action: Add `lang=\"en\"` to the <html> element to specify that the content language is English.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"en\"><head></head><body></body></html>`"
