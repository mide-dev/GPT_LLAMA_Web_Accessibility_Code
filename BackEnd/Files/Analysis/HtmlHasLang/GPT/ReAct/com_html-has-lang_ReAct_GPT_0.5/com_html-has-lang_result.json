Since \"登录机构账号\" is Simplified Chinese, it's more accurate to use `lang=\"zh-CN\"` for Mainland China. If the target audience is in Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Macau, where Traditional Chinese is used, `lang=\"zh-TW\"` or other appropriate language tags might be more suitable. However, without specific regional information, `lang=\"zh\"` or `lang=\"zh-CN\"` is a reasonable choice.\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"zh-CN\">`"
