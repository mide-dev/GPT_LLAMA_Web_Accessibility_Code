        "rawOutput": "To correct the HTML for accessibility based on the WCAG 2.1 violation described, we need to add a `lang` attribute to the `<html>` element. However, since the extracted text from the website is not provided, I'll assume the website's primary language is English for this example. If the primary language is different, the `lang` attribute value should be adjusted accordingly to match the primary language of the content.\n\n- Thought: The `<html>` element is missing a `lang` attribute, which is crucial for accessibility as it helps screen readers and other assistive technologies provide the correct language support.\n  \n- Observation: Without the extracted text, the default assumption for language will be English, which is commonly used. However, it's important to set the `lang` attribute to the correct language if it's known.\n  \n- Action: Add `lang=\"en\"` to the HTML element to specify that the content is in English.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"en\">`\n\nIf the website's content is not in English, replace `\"en\"` with the appropriate language code."
