This attribute helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the language of the page content, ensuring that it can be accurately interpreted and presented to users. To correct this, I need to add the \"lang\" attribute and specify the primary language of the document.\n\n- Action: Add `lang=\"en\"` to the HTML if the content is in English. If the content is in another language, replace \"en\" with the appropriate language code.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"en\">`"
