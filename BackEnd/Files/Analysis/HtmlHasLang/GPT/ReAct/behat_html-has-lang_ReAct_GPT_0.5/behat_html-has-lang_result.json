This helps in accessibility, especially for screen readers, by allowing them to correctly pronounce content based on the specified language.\n\n- Action: Add `lang=\"en\"` to the HTML assuming the content is in English. If the content is in another language, the appropriate language code should be used instead.\n\n- Corrected HTML: `<html lang=\"en\">`"
