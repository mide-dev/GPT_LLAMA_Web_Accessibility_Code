      Example 1:
      - Incorrect HTML: <div role="textbox" contenteditable="true"></div>
      - Corrected HTML: <div role="textbox" contenteditable="true" aria-multiline="true aria-label="Enter your hobbies" aria-required="true"></div>


      Example 1:
      - Incorrect HTML: <div role="textbox" contenteditable="true"></div>
      - Thought: Because the above div element have a role of textbox, I need to add all WCAG required aria attributes (aria-multiline, aria-label, and aria-required) that is needed for a textbox according to WCAG 2.1.
      - Corrected HTML: <div role="textbox" contenteditable="true" aria-multiline="true aria-label="Enter your hobbies" aria-required="true"></div>
  

        Example 1:
      - Incorrect HTML: <div role="textbox" contenteditable="true"></div>
      - Thought: Because the above div element have a role of textbox, I need to add all WCAG 2.1 required aria attributes that is needed for a textbox to fix the issue.
      - Observation: an element with a role="textbox" needs multiple attributes (aria-multiline, aria-label, and aria-required) according to WCAG.
      - Action: add[ria-multiline="true aria-label="Enter your hobbies" aria-required="true"] to the HTML.
      - Corrected HTML: <div role="textbox" contenteditable="true" aria-multiline="true aria-label="Enter your hobbies" aria-required="true"></div>
